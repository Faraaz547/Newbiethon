        <h3>What is cybersecurity, and why is it important?</h3>
        <h4>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. It is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, preventing financial losses, and maintaining the integrity of digital assets.</h4>
        <h3>What are common cyber threats individuals should be aware of?</h3>
        <h4>Common cyber threats include phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, and identity theft. Being aware of these threats helps individuals take preventive measures to secure their online presence.</h4>
        <h3>How can I create strong and secure passwords?</h3>
        <h4>Strong passwords should be a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or names. It's essential to use unique passwords for different accounts.</h4>
        <h3>What is two-factor authentication (2FA), and why should I use it?</h3>
        <h4>2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, usually a code sent to their mobile device. It significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.</h4>
        <h3>How can I identify phishing emails and avoid falling for scams?</h3>
        <h4> Be cautious of unexpected emails, check sender addresses, look for spelling mistakes, and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Legitimate organizations usually do not ask for sensitive information via email.</h4>
        <h3>What steps can I take to secure my home Wi-Fi network?</h3>
        <h4>Change default router login credentials, enable WPA3 encryption, regularly update router firmware, and use a strong Wi-Fi password. Restrict access to your network and consider implementing a guest network for visitors.</h4>
        <h3>Why is keeping software and devices updated crucial for cybersecurity?</h3>
        <h4>Updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities. Regularly updating operating systems, antivirus software, and applications is essential to protect against the latest threats.</h4>
        <h3>How can I protect my personal information on social media platforms?</h3>
        <h4>Review and adjust privacy settings, be cautious about sharing sensitive information, avoid accepting friend requests from unknown individuals, and regularly review and update your security settings.</h4>
        <h3>What is encryption, and how does it enhance data security?</h3>
        <h4>Encryption involves encoding data so that only authorized parties can access it. It adds a layer of protection, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be easily deciphered without the appropriate encryption keys.</h4>
        <h3>What should I do if I suspect my computer has been infected with malware?</h3>
        <h4>Disconnect from the internet, run a reputable antivirus scan, and follow the recommended steps for malware removal. It's essential to contact a cybersecurity professional if the issue persists or if sensitive information may have been compromised.</h4>
